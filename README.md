# Python Server Manager CLI

A Command Line Interface (CLI) tool designed to manage a mock server inventory. This project demonstrates modular Python architecture, CRUD operations, and standard Git workflows.

## Features
- **Add Servers:** Dynamically add new instances to the inventory.
- **Remove Servers:** Safely decommission servers with validation checks.
- **List Inventory:** View the current status of all managed resources.
- **Modular Design:** Separation of concerns between user interface (main.py) and logic (resource_manager.py).

## Usage
Run the tool using Python:
```bash
python3 main.py
